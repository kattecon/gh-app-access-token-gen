# Github App Access Token Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This Git repository contains a simple GitHub Action that generates
a GitHub Access Token based upon specific inputs.

Access tokens are necessary in GitHub Actions when the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
does not provide the required permissions to perform certain actions.
The GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions, when used to perform
tasks, [will not trigger new workflow runs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).
Because the GITHUB_TOKEN has limitations and cannot trigger new workflow runs
in certain cases, actions that want to perform actions that trigger a workflow
need to use a different token. An access token with the necessary permissions
can be used for this purpose, and this action can be used to generate such a token.

The action takes in some inputs and uses them to create a token that can be
used to interact with the GitHub API.

## Rationale

The rationale behind this repository is to maintain simplicity and security
at the forefront. It should be noted that the token generator may not be
entirely suitable for all potential use cases due to limited flexibility.
As a deliberate measure, customization options such as the utilization of custom
GitHub URLs have been intentionally excluded. This decision was made based on
the principle that less functionality translates to reduced testing and
maintenance efforts, fewer bugs, easier code review, and less susceptibility
to security vulnerabilities. The code base consist of a single short
typescript source code [file](./src/index.ts).

## Inputs

-   **app_id**: Required. Number. Github App Id - found in the app settings.
-   **private_key**: Required. String. The private key of the GitHub App in
    PEM format.
    This includes -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    markers.
-   **installation_id**: Optional. Number. The ID of the app
    installation - found in url of the installation. If not provided, the
    default is the ID of an installation found using the repository input for
    the action.
-   **repository**: Optional. String. Repository name in the format owner/repo.
    Default value is the name of the current repository. The value is only used
    if **installation_id** is not provided. The repository is used to get the
    installation id for the app. It's expected the app is installed in the
    provided repository.

## Outputs

-   **token**: The generated GitHub Access Token.

## Examples

### With app_id, primary key, repository name

View some other repository **that-org/that-repo** from this one without
specifying installation id. Note that the app with the given primary key must
actually be installed in the **that-org/that-repo**, but not required
in the current repository:

```yaml
- name: Generate an access token using app_id, pk and repo-name
  id: gen_token
  uses: kattecon/gh-app-access-token-gen@v1
  with:
      app_id: 12345 # Or rather use a value from secrets/vars.
      private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PK }}
      repository: that-org/that-repo

- name: Perform an action on behalf of the app
  env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.gen_token.outputs.token }}
  run: gh repo view that-org/that-repo
```

### With app_id, primary key, installation_id

View some other repository **that-org/that-repo** using an explicitly
given installation id. The given installation is the one that gives
access to that-org/that-repo in the example:

```yaml
- name: Generate an access token using app_id, pk and installation id
  id: gen_token
  uses: kattecon/gh-app-access-token-gen@v1
  with:
      app_id: 12345 # Or rather use a value from secrets/vars.
      private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PK }}
      installation_id: 54321 # Or rather use a value from secrets/vars.

- name: Perform an action on behalf of the app
  env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.gen_token.outputs.token }}
  run: gh repo view that-org/that-repo
```

### With app_id, primary key

View some other repository **that-org/that-repo** assuming that the repository
of the running workflow and the **that-org/that-repo** are included into the
same installation of the app with the given private key:

```yaml
- name: Generate an access token using app_id, pk
  id: gen_token
  uses: kattecon/gh-app-access-token-gen@v1
  with:
      app_id: 12345 # Or rather use a value from secrets/vars.
      private_key: ${{ secrets.MY_APP_PK }}

- name: Perform an action on behalf of the app
  env:
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.gen_token.outputs.token }}
  run: gh repo view that-org/that-repo
```
